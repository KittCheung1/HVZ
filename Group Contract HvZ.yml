#Group Contract HvZ

1. Routine:
The work takes place according to SCRUMS principles.

- Daily Scrum -
Standup meeting every day where everyone goes through their work tasks, how it goes, if you need help.
We work according to agreed Code guidelines (based on PEP 8).

2. Communication in the group:
Contact through text and voice channels via Discord and via telephone or email if necessary.
Tasks to work with are listed in the Trello.
Announce to the rest of the team members if you are late or can not come.
Do not be late for the scheduled meeting. 
Constructive discussions about all project-related topics are welcome.

Developer: Gabriel Andersson, Thomas Annerfeldt,  Kitt Cheung, Joachim Nilsson

5. Resources:
Number of group members: 4
Time: 2 sprints every week.
Basic working hours: within the hours 08.00 -16.30

6. Responsibilities and consequences:
Work is distributed continuously. It is important to put your name as "Owner" on the task-cards you work with, and to ensure that these are placed in the right category, for example. "Ready for development", "In development", "Completed".
At the end of the Task, you are generally expected to pick a new Task to work with from Trello, or offer help to another group member's ongoing story.
If you think that there are missing Tasks which should be a part of the project, then you are free to create these Tasks in Trello.
If you have problems implementing your task, you should raise this at a SCRUM meeting or ask for help from other group members.
In the event of absence, the member is responsible for contacting the group leader or another group member for the transfer of work tasks.
